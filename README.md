## About

GMK Keycap Colors is a comprehensive database that organizes 400+ GMK keycap sets by color, created specifically for the mechanical keyboard community. Built with Kotlin and Android Studio/XML, it provides a simple, intuitive design and a well-structured index of sets designed by various talented creators.

The app integrates with Matrix Zouâ€™s GitHub/website [github/website](https://matrixzj.github.io/docs/gmk-keycaps) to offer additional details on each keycap set. GMK Keycap Colors was developed to fill a gap in the market, allowing enthusiasts to easily find keycap sets by color, eliminating the need for time-consuming searches for the perfect match for their keyboards.

There wasn't a website or application that filtered these keycaps into a specific color that you wanted. Which was why I created one myself, to stop the endless hours of searching for the perfect keycap set to match your board!
